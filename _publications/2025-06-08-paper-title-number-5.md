excerpt: 'Abstract— This paper reports the application of a root-finding method, the Muller method, for predicting machining stability in turning processes exhibiting process damping-related nonlinearities. We use the method to evaluate the process stability of a flexible tool modelled as a single degree of freedom system that interacts with a rotating workpiece. The system experiences the regeneration phenomena responsible for chatter. Prediction accuracies of the proposed method are found to agree with standard frequency and time domain methods of solving the resulting nonlinear delay differential equation. Though the method is computationally more demanding than the others, its advantages lie in being easy to implement and in being robust in handling process-related nonlinearities.'

Abstract— This paper reports the application of a root-finding method, the Muller method, for predicting machining stability in turning processes exhibiting process damping-related nonlinearities. We use the method to evaluate the process stability of a flexible tool modelled as a single degree of freedom system that interacts with a rotating workpiece. The system experiences the regeneration phenomena responsible for chatter. Prediction accuracies of the proposed method are found to agree with standard frequency and time domain methods of solving the resulting nonlinear delay differential equation. Though the method is computationally more demanding than the others, its advantages lie in being easy to implement and in being robust in handling process-related nonlinearities
