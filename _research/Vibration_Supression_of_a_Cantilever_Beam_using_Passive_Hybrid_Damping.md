-	Designed a passive hybrid damping system by incorporating ECD (eddy current damping) with a permanent magnet and CLD (constrained layer damping) with linear viscoelastic material
-	Modeled the beam as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, with Eddy current damping (ECD) represented as a linear damping force, and constrained layer damping (CLD) modeled as shear dissipative work
-	Solved elliptic integrals in the Eddy current damping force using the Gauss-quadrature method; addressed complexity in viscoelastic material (VEM) modeling by representing shear strain as shear dissipative work within the generalized Hamilton principle framework
-	Performed a theoretical analysis of the designed system to show its effectiveness (it was found that the proposed system reduced the vibrations by 89%)
