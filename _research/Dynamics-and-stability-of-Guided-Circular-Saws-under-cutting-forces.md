- Mathematical modeling of rotating hydrodynamically lubricated guided saw under the influence of regenerative and normal cutting forces using Von Karman's plate theory and extended Hamilton's principle
- Analyzed the obtained non-linear equations using eignevalue analysis and Muller’s method in MATLAB & MAPLE
- Results are instructive in design of guides, their numbers, selection of fluids for guided rotating systems
