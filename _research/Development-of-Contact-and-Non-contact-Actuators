excerpt: "Designed electromagnetic actuators for active vibration control and optimized them using MATLAB."

- Designed electromagnetic actuators for active vibration control with a force output of 100N, modeled the design as magnetic circuits and optimized it using MATLAB optimization toolbox
- Simulated the functioning of the designed actuators in COMSOL Multiphysics and fabricated the actuators
- Participated in product exhibition held in IIT Delhi sponsored by IMPRINT’19, Gov. of India to present the project
