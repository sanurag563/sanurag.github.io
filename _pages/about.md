I am Anurag, a mechanical engineer driven by curiosity and passion, specializing in dynamics, machining, and vibrations. I hold a B.Tech–M.Tech dual degree with Distinction in Design and Manufacturing Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, critical thinking, and detail-oriented problem-solving. I thrive on applying first principles and multidisciplinary approaches to tackle complex engineering challenges. During my master’s research, I worked on “Regenerative instabilities of metal cutting circular saws with lubricated and distributed guides” under the guidance of [Prof. Mohit Law](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mlaw/), and developed a mathematical model to optimize the guide design, determine the required number of guides, and select appropriate cooling fluids for enhanced performance in metal cutting saws.

Current Assignment (Sept'25 - Present)
---
I am presently working as a Research and Development Engineer in the [Machine Tool Dynamics Laboratory](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mlaw/), Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My research focuses on the development of a smart toolholder for real-time condition monitoring in machining applications. This work integrates vibration, temperature, force, and torque sensors with custom-designed electronic circuits for signal conditioning and processing.

Industry Experience (Aug'21 - Aug'25)
---
I bring four years of professional experience in product design, development, and requirement engineering at the Eaton India Innovation Center, Pune, within the Aerospace [Interconnect Technology Division](https://www.eaton.com/in/en-us/markets/aerospace/interconnect.html), where I served as an R&D Product Engineer. In this role, I was responsible for the design and development of custom backshells for major OEMs, including Boeing, Fokker, and Airbus, as well as the design of new optical connectors. I also led CAD automation initiatives that streamlined repetitive design tasks, resulting in significant cost reductions. This position also provided significant international exposure, as I collaborated with global teams in the USA, Mexico, and France, coordinating design and testing activities across multiple stakeholders. Beyond technical contributions, I assumed leadership responsibilities in engineering quality management, where I spearheaded the AS9100D certification process at the team level. This involved drafting process documentation, implementing compliance frameworks, and conducting training sessions to ensure adherence across the engineering team. In addition, I served as an expert and trainer for AERO-ENOVIA PLM software, successfully training and mentoring over 100 engineers, and worked as a design checker, reviewing more than 200 technical documents.
