I am a passionate mechanical engineer with a specialization in dynamics, machining, vibrations, and controls. Armed with a Distinction in B.Tech-M.Tech in Design engineering from the India Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, I possess a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, critical thinking, and attention to detail skills. Adept at leveraging the first principles and a multidisciplinary approach to solve complex problems. During my master's I worked on "Regenerative instabilities of metal cutting circular saws with lubricated and distributed guides" and developed a methmatical model to ease the design of guide, their number, and cooling fluid selection for metal cutting saws.

I have four years of industry experience in product design, development, and requirement engineering at EATON India Innovation Center, Pune in Aerospace interconnect technology division ([ITD, EATON](https://www.eaton.com/in/en-us/markets/aerospace/interconnect.html)), where I worked as product engineer. My role involved leading the design and development of custom backshells for various OEMs (Boeing, Fokker, Airbus). Apart from technical roles I was also leading the AS9100D (engineering quality management system at team level, which required creation of process documents and traning the team on the same) certification, worked as expert and traniner for AERO-ENOVIA PLM software and trained 100+ engineers. I gained experties in "Requirement mangement", "GD&T", "DfSS", "Project Management", "SolidWorks", "Enovia (PLM)" and "AS9100D".

Currently, I am working as a research and development engineer in the [Machine Tool Dynamics Lab](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mlaw/), IIT Kanpur. And developing a smart tool holder plug and play device for real time condition monitoring.

My research focus areas are dynamics, vibration, controls, digital manufacturing, machining dynamics, hybrid manufacturing, and robotics.
