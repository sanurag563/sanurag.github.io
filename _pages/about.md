I am Anurag, a mechanical engineer driven by curiosity and passion, specializing in dynamics, machining, and vibrations. I hold a B.Tech–M.Tech dual degree with Distinction in Design and Manufacturing Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, critical thinking, and detail-oriented problem solving. I thrive on applying first principles and multidisciplinary approaches to tackle complex engineering challenges. During my master’s research, I worked on “regenerative instabilities of metal cutting circular saws with lubricated and distributed guides” under the guidance of [Prof. Mohit Law](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mlaw/), and developed a mathematical model to optimize the guide design, determine the required number of guides, and select appropriate cooling fluids for enhanced performance in metal cutting saws.

Current assignment (Sept'25 - Present)

I am presently working as a Research and Development Engineer in the [Machine Tool Dynamics Laboratory](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~mlaw/), Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. My research focuses on the development of a smart toolholder for real-time condition monitoring in machining applications. This work integrates vibration, temperature, force, and torque sensors with custom-designed electronic circuits for signal conditioning and processing.

Industry Experience (Aug'21 - Aug'25)
---
I bring four years of professional experience in product design, development, and requirement engineering at the Eaton India Innovation Center, Pune, within the Aerospace [Interconnect Technology Division](https://www.eaton.com/in/en-us/markets/aerospace/interconnect.html), where I served as an R&D Product Engineer. In this role, I was responsible for the design and development of custom backshells for major OEMs, including Boeing, Fokker, and Airbus, as well as the design of new optical connectors. I also led CAD automation initiatives that streamlined repetitive design tasks, resulting in significant cost reductions. This position also provided significant international exposure, as I collaborated with global teams in the USA, Mexico, and France, coordinating design and testing activities across multiple stakeholders. Beyond technical contributions, I assumed leadership responsibilities in engineering quality management, where I spearheaded the AS9100D certification process at the team level. This involved drafting process documentation, implementing compliance frameworks, and conducting training sessions to ensure adherence across the engineering team. In addition, I served as an expert and trainer for AERO-ENOVIA PLM software, successfully training and mentoring over 100 engineers, and worked as a design checker, reviewing more than 200 technical documents.
Through these experiences, I developed expertise in: 
1. Requirement Management
2. Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T)
3. Design for Six Sigma (DfSS)
4. Project Management
5. SolidWorks
6. ENOVIA (PLM)
7. AS9100D Quality Systems (defines quality management requirements for organizations in aviation, space, and defense)
8. Digitalization of CAD modeling
